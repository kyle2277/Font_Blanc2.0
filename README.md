# Font Blanc 2.0
## Overview
Welcome to the new and improved Font Blanc data encryption algorithm, rebuilt from the ground up!
Font Blanc 2.0 (FB2) no longer relies on the archaic Hill Cypher matrix encryption technology utilized by Arkadiusz2.0. FB2 uses __variable-dimension permutation matrix transformations__ which reorder byte data in a manner unique to the encryption key.
